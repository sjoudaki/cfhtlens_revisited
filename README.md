# CFHTLenS Revisited

The file cosmicshear.f90 calculates the 2pt shear correlation functions \xi_+ and \xi_- accounting for key astrophysical systematics coming from intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic effects in the nonlinear matter power spectrum, and photometric redshift uncertainties. The file meadfitsj.f90 includes HMcode as a separate module in CosmoMC for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. These are both compatible with the July-2015 version of CosmoMC. 

Updated CFHTLenS cosmic shear tomography measurements are also included, as described in the tarball. 

The measurements and fitting pipeline are presented in http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05786. For the original version of HMcode, please see https://github.com/alexander-mead/hmcode.
